# GenZ DatingApp - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Machine Learning (ML)

This project focuses on analyzing data from a GenZ Dating App to uncover insights, trends, and predictive models. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 📊 Project Overview

The primary goals of this project are to:
- Explore and understand the dating app dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Apply machine learning models for predictive analysis

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Summary statistics, correlation analysis, and trend identification.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Classification and regression models to predict user behaviors and outcomes.
- **Visualizations:** Graphs and charts for better understanding of the data.
